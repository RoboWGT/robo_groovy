Note: All *.owl files are generated automatically from the *.owl.in files when calling 'make' in the package re_ontology. The make procedure replaces placeholder values with the correct paths to referenced files.

== Base ontology: roboearth.owl ==

This file contains class definitions used for describing RoboEarth-related topics. It is derived from knowrob.owl which serves as the base ontology and comprises class and property descriptions for a variety of objects, actions and events. Further, roboearth.owl includes SRDL, the semantic robot description language, that provides methods for matching requirements of actions against robot capabilities.

roboearth.owl extends these ontologies with descriptions of actions, capabilities and robot components that are specific for the RoboEarth context.


== Object model: object_model.owl ==

An example object model is described in object_model.owl. The description mainly provides information about the object classes that can be recognized with this model, the creation time, the algorithm used and the exact type of the model. A link relates to the model file that can be used by the object recognition algorithm.


== Environment map: environment_map.owl ==

This file describes the kitchen lab at the IAS group in Munich in terms of the pieces of furniture it contains. The resulting 'map' can not easily be used for navigation, but rather describes what can be found where in the environment. Like for the object model, a link to a binary file could provide e.g. an occupancy grid map.


== Action recipe: joystick_drive.owl ==

A very simple set of action commands is given in joystick_drive.owl. Such a file can already be automatically generated by the re_comm ROS module.
